Why choose the sof.solutions instead of the well known sof.com

The answer is don't. .com has a different use case then .solutions

So here are the main differences:
  - in sof.com you come with the question
  - in sof.solutions you come with the solution

Is like when you're working on something and you don't know what to do you
ask yourself "How should I do that?" then you search it on google and if you
cannot find anything you go to sof.com and ask that particular question and
surely somebody will answer.

That is great. But what happens to the other one million people that will have the
same issue? They will have to do the same thing, search it on google, some will
find the sof.com answer, some will find their answer on some forum and others in
documentation. But shouldn't we collect all those answers in the form of
unique, updated, standardized, indexed solutions?

Problems with sof.com:
  - there are a lot of duplicated answers that you have to dissect
  - sometimes there are questions with a different answer then the title says
  - I saw old answers since 2009 or even 2006, I don't know what version is or if
    is still a valid answer
  - the question receives multiple answers and I don't know which one to choose
  - a lot of comments are important for the answer but you don't read them
  - not all the answers have links to documentation
  - not all the answers have links to running examples
  - not all the answers have version number of the framework or language
  - the language or framework is a tag, when searching on google you hope for
  the best but you are not sure that you will get the right answer
  - sometimes the solution is not on sof.com, it might be on another forum, so
  that question will never be asket as everybody who searches on google will land
  first on that forum

This is why a come up with sof.solutions.

Improvements that sof.solutions theoretically resolve:
  - there are no duplicated solutions, duplication is not allowed
  - all the solutions are improved with time
  - all the solutions are up to date
  - all the solutions have version number of the framework or language
    - you can search by version number
  - you can search inside the context of a language or framework
  - all the solutions are the result of the common work of a team
    - instead of 10 people giving 10 answers, 10 people will work together to
    give the best and most complex answer that can be.
  - when you find the answer to your question, you put it on sof.solutions too
  (even if that is just a link to some tutorial), so that chances are that one
  day, everytime someone searches for a question, the answer will be right here
  - you can have your private solution in case you don't like the default one,
  so that you or your team can work with a more fitting solution. Elso is a form
  of self private documentation of your work.
  - the creators of the languages, frameworks and libraries have
  the right to give the default solution to a question related to
  their product; like Chris McCord or Jos√© Valim in case of this
  solution related to the phoenix framework, I observed that this
  solution is recommended so I favored this one instead of others
  considered better by other people

So, use sof.com when
  - you want multiple answers from multiple people
  - you need an answer to a new question never asked before
  - you need an answer to a particular and personal question

And use sof.solutions when
 - you want the best and unique solution that is the result of a team work
 - you need an up to date solution
 - you need a solution to a particular version of your framework or language
 - you need an application that is the starting point of your research
 - you need a pocket application at your right hand to help you quickly
 find your answers to your daily "How to" questions
